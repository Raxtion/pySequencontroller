Hello! I am Raxtion.                            (raxkuo@hotmail.com)
Thank you for using this tool.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a small tool for sequence changing in life science, and it's eazy
using like a Calculator.
Every sequence will load in the top TextBox, and click "Clean" to start 
the work.
Notes for special function:
	1: It can read FastA file, and can save sequence in FastA file.
	2: You can change the "MultylineOutput" window size, and click 
	   "MultylineOutput" ComboBox again to select which Output you 
	   like.
	3: The "Controlplate" is still no function. I wanted to create 
	   a plate to add the sequence color, larger, background...
	   But it is more easy to finish on "Microsoft Word". If users 
	   wanted add any function, please tell me. Thanks.
	4: Click "Reset" or restart the app. will generate a new work.
	
If there were any bug in app., let me know.
(Thanks the GeneCode figure source from google and the Windows ICON.
It a little tool for research, not engaged in for profit.)
Best

                                                  Wi-Tin Kuo(Raxtion)
